   ```

2. **Clone this repo** and enter its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tom-toupence/durian-maturity-classification.git
   cd durian-maturity-classification
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
